We help teams build and deploy LLM applications at scale with our managed vector database platform. Our platform makes it easy to store, manage, and search vector embeddings, which are the numerical representations of data objects that LLMs use to understand and generate text.

We use the open-source Chroma vector database, which is fast and easy to use, making it ideal for LLM applications. Chroma is one of the fastest vector databases available, with support for sub-millisecond nearest neighbor search. It is also easy to use, with a simple REST API and a Python client library.
