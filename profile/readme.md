# Oasys

We are a managed vector database platform that helps teams build and deploy large language model (LLM) applications at scale. Our platform makes it easy to store, manage, and search vector embeddings, which are the numerical representations of data objects that LLMs use to understand and generate text.

We are proud to be using the open-source Chroma vector database as the foundation of our platform. Chroma is a highly scalable and performant vector database that is specifically designed for large language model applications. Some of its key advantages are that it is fast and easy to use.

Chroma is one of the fastest vector databases available, with support for sub-millisecond nearest neighbor search. It is also easy to use, with a simple REST API and a Python client library.
